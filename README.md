Hi. I'm a complete novice at this. Lucky for me I understand well the concept of revision control. As a mechanical designer there is nothing more annoying than working in an environment that does not have some sort of revision control system. Annoying is an understatement. Bad things can happen if your design (3D models or code) gets overwritten or released in an incorrect version.
